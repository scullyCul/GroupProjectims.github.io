<td><font color=#104340 size=3> Quality education is the main focus of Rumah Aman for the children. There is a Malay saying "Membentuk aur biarlah dari rebung" which can be literally translated as "To bend a bamboo, begin from the shoot". This is the basis why Rumah Aman enrolled children from the age of three to six years old into the orphanage and welfare home. Rumah Aman's education programme is a continuous learning of life skills based on the Quran and the Sunna of Prophet Muhammad sallallahu 'alaihi wasallam (May Allah bless him and grant him peace) and integrated with the knowledge of the time. This continuous learning is for all who are with Rumah Aman whether permanent staffs or volunteers because they will be the role models for the children to follow as the maxim goes "children copy adults". This pattern of learning is paramount because only then the children will have a strong foundation in the Deen of Islam as well as a basis for them to be victorious in this world and in the Hereafter. The education programme of Rumah Aman is called I-SMART.
