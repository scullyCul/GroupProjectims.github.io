<th>It has been a long time dream for Abdul Rehman Dakri and his wife Mehrunessa to establish an orphanage for the poor and needy children once they retire. Finally, after visiting a few countries, by the grace of Allah, they decided to make Malaysia their home. In England, Abdul Rehman was very active in community work and was an active volunteer for Garden of Peace, a charity organisation in Ilford, East London which established and managed a cemetery for the Muslims (www.garden-of-peace.org.uk). To realise their dream, Our Home : Rumah Aman was registered with the Charity Commission for England and Wales in March 2004. The name Rumah Aman which means Peaceful Home was researched by a friend in England. Rumah Aman (Shah Alam) Berhad, a company limited by guarantee was then registered with the Companies Commission of Malaysia in January 2005 to manage Rumah Aman Orphanage and Welfare Home which began operations in Shah Alam, Selangor in June the same year. Abdul Rehman and his wife came to Malaysia in 2003 and are now residing under the Malaysia My Second Home Programme. He envisions establishing another 13 orphanages including for girls, throughout the country. Abdul Rehman Dakri being the founder of Rumah Aman is also the director of Rumah Aman (Shah Alam) since the company's inception in January 2005.
